# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. The client is Seoul Bike, which participates in a bike share program in Seoul, South Korea. An accurate prediction of bike count is critical to the success of the Seoul bike share program. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. ïƒ˜

 The final aim of this project is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes
